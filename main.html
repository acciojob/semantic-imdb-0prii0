		Chhichhore is a 2019 Hindi film that beautifully blends college nostalgia with an inspiring story about failure and friendship. The movie follows Anirudh (played by Sushant Singh Rajput), a middle-aged man whose son attempts suicide after failing an entrance exam. To help his son recover, Anirudh reunites with his college friends and shares stories of their time in college—how they were once labeled "losers" but learned to face challenges with courage and unity.

The film delivers a strong message: failure is not the end, and what truly matters is how we deal with it. It mixes humor, emotions, and life lessons, making it a heartwarming and motivational watch.
